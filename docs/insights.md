 # Teens = Biggest Untapped Potential

 Despite receiving only ~15% of the total budget, Teens show the highest conversion rates, far outperforming Adults (~40% budget, average results) and Seniors (~35% budget, lowest conversion rates).


## Strategic Implication
 Teens are massively underinvested: lowest budget share (15%), but the highest ROI (~8% VCR through Emails & ~3% overall). TikTok + Email emerges as the strongest performing funnel.


## Recommendations:
Reallocate 25–30% of budget toward Teens
Develop teen-specific email campaigns
Prioritize TikTok + Email funnel
Email–Teens Paradox
 Teens treat email as a “serious communication channel” compared to being overloaded with content on social platforms. This makes email a surprisingly effective lever in this segment.


     Teens represent the most underutilized yet highest-potential growth opportunity for MarketFlash.
